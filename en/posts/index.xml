      <description>Three volunteers. A couple of weeks of work. That&amp;rsquo;s what it took to add a language to BigScience BLOOM, the open multilingual language model with no fewer than 176 billion parameters that was released mid-2022. It aimed to become an open and multilingual alternative to GPT-3. In the end, 46 languages from all over the world made it into the dataset BLOOM was trained on. Even relatively small languages like Basque and Catalan managed to be included.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t often publicly share details about the kind of projects we undertake at the Netherlands Forensic Institute with the help of AI, but at the recent EuroPython 2023 in Prague, I was able to discuss a case that unfolded a few years ago and on which the NFI had previously issued a press release: the Threat-to-Life project.
Police could read along with criminals In 2020, the police managed to read live messages from a provider of so-called cryptophones: modified phones that — for a substantial payment — were used for encrypted communication in the criminal circuit.</description>

      <title>GEITje 7B: A Large Open Dutch Language Model</title>

      <description>It has been more than two weeks since I open-sourced GEITje 7B. It was an exciting moment, especially since this is my first major open source contribution. But I am very pleased to see how enthusiastic all the reactions have been!
GEITje is a large open Dutch language model with 7 billion parameters, based on Mistral 7B. It has been further trained on 10 billion tokens of Dutch text. This has improved its Dutch language skills and increased its knowledge of Dutch topics.</description>
