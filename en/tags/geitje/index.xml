      <description>The first in a series of posts about questions I get about GEITje.
&amp;ldquo;Why did you create a language model?&amp;rdquo; I have received this question several times in recent weeks. Usually immediately followed by a follow-up question: &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t ChatGPT already exist?&amp;rdquo; Not a strange question, actually. Here are my three main reasons:
1. Because open models are needed ChatGPT performs great in Dutch. If you have an application where you want to try a LLM, definitely go for ChatGPT or one of the OpenAI APIs.</description>

      <description>It has been more than two weeks since I open-sourced GEITje 7B. It was an exciting moment, especially since this is my first major open source contribution. But I am very pleased to see how enthusiastic all the reactions have been!
GEITje is a large open Dutch language model with 7 billion parameters, based on Mistral 7B. It has been further trained on 10 billion tokens of Dutch text. This has improved its Dutch language skills and increased its knowledge of Dutch topics.</description>
